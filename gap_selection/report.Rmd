The goal of this analysis is to determine the mean life expectancy in countries in Asia and Europe. The `gapminder` data set contain life expectancy data from 12 different years. For each country, I calculated the mean life expectancy of those years. Let's have a look at Asia first:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
Asia_data <- read_csv("Asia/Asia_selection.csv")

kable(head(Asia_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```

How many countries in Asia do we have data from?

```{r}
nrow(Asia_data)
```

There are 33 countries included in the data from Asia.

What is the lowest and highest mean life expectancy?

```{r}
round(min(Asia_data$mean_lifeExp), 2)
round(max(Asia_data$mean_lifeExp), 2)
```

The lowest life expectancy in a country in Asia is 37 years, the highest is 75 years.

Here is a plot of the mean life expectancy in each country, sorted by mean life expectancy:

Looks like Afghanistan has the lowest mean life expectancy and Japan has the highest.

Let's have a look at the same data from Europe:

```{r, message = FALSE}
Europe_data <- read_csv("Europe/Europe_selection.csv")

kable(head(Europe_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```

How many countries are included in the Europe data?

```{r}
nrow(Europe_data)
```

There are 30 countries from Europe.

What are the lowest and highest mean life expectancies in Europe?

```{r}
round(min(Europe_data$mean_lifeExp), 2)
round(max(Europe_data$mean_lifeExp), 2)
```

The lowest life expectancy in Europe is 60 years, the highest it 77 years. Here is the plot of mean life expectancies for each country in Europe:
