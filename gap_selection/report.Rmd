The goal of this analysis is to determine the mean life expectancy in countries of each continent. The `gapminder` data set contains life expectancy data from 12 different years. For each country, I calculated the mean life expectancy of those years. I excluded Oceania from this analysis as it only contains 2 countries and is not very interesting to look at. Let's have a look at Asia first:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

Asia_data <- read_csv("Asia/Asia_selection.csv")

kable(head(Asia_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```

Here is a plot of the mean life expectancy in each country, sorted by mean life expectancy:

Looks like Afghanistan has the lowest mean life expectancy and Japan has the highest.

Let's have a look at the same data from Europe:

```{r, message = FALSE}
Europe_data <- read_csv("Europe/Europe_selection.csv")

kable(head(Europe_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```


Here is the plot of mean life expectancies for each country in Europe:

Turkey has the lowest mean life expectancy in Europe, Iceland has the highest.

Next, we'll look at the data from the Americas:

```{r}
Americas_data <- read_csv("Americas/Americas_selection.csv")

kable(head(Americas_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```

Here is the plot of mean life expectancies for each country in the Americas:

Haiti has the lowest mean life expectancy of all countries in the Americas, Canada has the highest.

And here is a glimpse of the data from Africa:

```{r}
Africa_data <- read_csv("Africa/Africa_selection.csv")

kable(head(Africa_data), col.names = c("Country", "Mean Life Expectancy"))
```

Here is the plot of mean life expectancies for each country in Africa:

In Africa, Sierra Leone is the country with the lowest mean life expectancy, Reunion has the highest.
